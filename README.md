花学姐，我喜欢你啊！

I ever tried using [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) to make a menubar app on Windows but was stucked by this [issue](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar/issues/32)

No idea what's wrong with my computer so I start this project to build a npm module that is available for me.

Recently I like to pick a random name for my project, so don't ask why the name is hua, no reason at all, if you can't stop wondering, I might say, "love". 😃
